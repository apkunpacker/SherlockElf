# SherlockElf üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**SherlockElf** is a powerful tool designed for both static and dynamic analysis of Android ELF binaries. It helps security researchers, developers, and reverse engineers gain insights into ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) binaries used in Android applications.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Static Analysis**: Extracts and analyzes metadata, headers, and sections from ELF binaries.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Executes and monitors ELF binaries to observe runtime behavior and identify potential vulnerabilities.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive command-line interface for easy interaction.
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Generates detailed analysis reports for further inspection.
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works seamlessly on multiple platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To get started with SherlockElf, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iamtorsten/SherlockElf.git
    cd SherlockElf
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Setup Environment**:
    - Magisk or KernelSu rooted Android Phone or Tablet
    - Running Frida Server on Phone
    - Installed Frida Tools on PC

## Usage üöÄ

Using SherlockElf is straightforward. Below are some common commands and their descriptions:

- **Static Analysis**:
    ```bash
    python emulate.py
    ```
    This command performs a static analysis on the specified ELF binary and outputs the results.
<br><br>
- **Dynamic Analysis**:
    ```python
    with open("hook/mem.js") as f:
        script_code = f.read()
  
    # Attach to the target process
    device: frida.core.Device = frida.get_usb_device()
    app = device.get_frontmost_application()
    if app:
        target = app.pid
    else:
        target = app_name
        session: frida.core.Session = device.attach(target)
        script = session.create_script(script_code)
        script.on('message', on_message)
        script.load()
    ```
    This command executes the ELF binary and monitors its memory behavior.
